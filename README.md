# Remove the embedlink button
This is a plugin for etherpad-lite.

It just removes the embedlink button from the frontend html.

This version removes it on the serverside (with jsdom+jquery), before it's sent to the client

DOESN'T WORKING BY NOW
<br>because eejs is working in a blocking way
<br>also requires the original jsdom installed in ep_etherpad-lite
